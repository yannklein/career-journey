    - Read the Career Playbook
    - Post your LinkedIn profile on the batch Slack channel, add your classmates and go to their profile to endorse them - you guys are more than qualified to be endorsed in Ruby on Rails, Git, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, etc..  it only takes 3-5 clicks and will add more legitimacy to your profile as a developer.
    Write some recommendations for your classmates too! You can ask someone to recommend you, but make sure you write one back if someone writes one for you.",
