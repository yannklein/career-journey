Today, we focus on building your portfolio!

## Our plan 📝

- Assemble a list of all of the social links you want to link on your portfolio site: your Github (pimp it with our tuto 👇), Medium, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.
- Pick a domain name for your site and purchase it. Useful tips: use a .com, .me, .tech, or a .io domain. Do not use .co as it often gets flagged as spam
- Fork 🍴 your Final projects, your Airbnb projects, Mr. Cocktail, any others and clean up the front end.
- Take a screenshot of your products’ landing page.
- Do a one paragraph write-up describing the challenges and solutions of the project. This can be as simple as the product card on the Kitt products page

_For bonus points:_ Take a video of your journey to upload to your site (this will be useful to share with potential clients too!)
