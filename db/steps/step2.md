Today, we prepare our github and portfolio with valuable content.

## The objectives ☕️

### Your GitHub
- Pimp your Github (intro, pins and descriptions) with our tuto 👇
- Fork 🍴 your final project and Airbnb project
- Clean up the front end of your Airbnb, Mr. Cocktail (and other bootcamp's) project

### Your portfolio - content preparation
- Assemble a list of all of the social links you want to link on your portfolio site: your Github, Medium, LinkedIn, Instagram, etc.
- Pick a domain name for your site and purchase it. Use a `.com`, `.me`, `.tech`, or a `.io` domain. Do not use `.co` as it often gets flagged as spam
- Take a screenshot of your projects’ landing page
- Do a one paragraph write-up describing the challenges and solutions of the project. This can be as simple as the product card on the Kitt products page

_**For bonus points:**_ Take a video of your journey to upload to your site (this will be useful to share with potential clients too!)
