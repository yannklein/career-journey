Time to build your portfolio!

## The objectives ‚òïÔ∏è

### Create your app using one of the following templates:

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ The simple route: `HTML` + `Netlify` (by [Maria](https://medium.com/@mariacodes))
1. Create an account on [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) 
2. (Optional) Get a head start on your development by using [this HTML boilerplate](https://github.com/maltyeva/html-template) for your site. Download the template and connect it to your domain using Netlify. Remember to enforce HTTPS! üîí
3. Add these meta tags to the `<head>` of your site. Here are Maria's, for reference:

```
<title>Maria Altyeva</title>
<meta charset=‚Äúutf-8‚Äù />
<meta name=‚Äúdescription‚Äù content=‚ÄúFull-Stack Developer and Agile Project Manager, based in Shanghai, China‚Äù>
<meta name=‚Äúkeywords‚Äù content=‚ÄúMaria Altyeva, developer,Ruby on Rails, RoR,HTML,JavaScript‚Äù>
<meta name=‚Äúauthor‚Äù content=‚ÄúMaria Altyeva‚Äù>
```
#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ `Middleman` - A mix of static HTML that feels like Rails + Netlify

Disclaimer: got some compatibility issues with bootstrap 4, but works on v3
1. Use our [LW boilerplate](https://github.com/lewagon/middleman-boilerplate)
2. Follow the [Middleman doc](https://middlemanapp.com/) üìö

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Go for the comfort of `Rails` + `Heroku`
1. Rails new with the [minimal template](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates#minimal)
2. Create your Heroku app to deploy

### After the app is created:

- Connect to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/)
- Add your projects and style to your portfolio
